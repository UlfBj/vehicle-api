# VAPI Implementations
The VAPI is a connectivity  agnostic API that defines procedures that enable access to signals and services.

The [VAPI Specification](/spec/) describes the procedures with input and output parameters that are invoked to execute the services,
or to access signals.
The implementation of these procedures can be done in different programming languages, and also using different connectivity  solutions for the serialization and transport of the service information.

The following combinations of connectivity solutions and programming languages are available:
* [[VISS]] / Go
