      <p>
        The Vehicle API (VAPI) specification defines an interface for access to vehicle signals and services.
        This access is realized by exposing a procedure-based interface to clients of it.
        For vehicle services there i a one-to-one mapping between a service and a procedure.
        For signals there are a set of reserved procedure signatures that are used to realize the signal access.
        This specification is agnostic to the connectivity solution that is used in implementations of it.
        A client may be deployed in-vehicle, but may also be deployed off-vehicle.
        These details are abstracted in the interface and dealt with in the implementation of the interface.

      <h2>VAPI Overview</h2>
      <p>
        VAPI procedures are characterized as belonging to one of the types Common, Signal, or Service.
      <ul>
          <li>
            The Common type contains all procedures that are not invoked to a specific vehicle, which the other two groups are.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Signal type contains the procedures that a client may use for access to vehicle signals.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Service type contains the procedures that a client may use for access to vehicle services.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Procedure characteristics:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Procedures that are invoked to a specific vehicle must include a vehicle ID as input parameter.
        </li>
        <li>
        Procedures representing services with an extended execution time shall include a pointer to a callback procedure as input parameter.
        The procedure must invoke the callback procedure at the successful termination of the service, or if the service terminates unsuccessfully.
        It may issue multiple invokations during the execution.
        A client that does not want to receive callback may set the input callback pointer to nil.
        </li>
        <li>
        The output data that is defined in the procedure signature must contain a ProcedureStatus parameter and an ErrorData parameter.<br>
        If the ProcedureStatus parameter is set to indicate unsuccessful execution then the ErrorData must be populated with information about the failure,
        else the poiner to it shall be set to nil.<br>
        The output data may include service specific parameters.<br>
        If the service does not terminate successfully then all service specific output parameters are invalid.<br>
        The output data shall be returned synchronously with the call of the service.
        Any asynchronous event messages shall use the same output data structure.<br>
        The output data shall be contained in a single struct.
        </li>
        <li>
        Procedures with an extended execution time must return a unique reference to the execution session.
        A client may use this reference to asynchronously terminate the ongoing execution.
        </li>
        <li>
        Procedures that change the state of the vehicle can typically not be executed in multiple parallelly executing instances,
        while the opposite is typically true for procedures that do not change the state of the vehicle.<br>
        Procedures that do not support multiple execution instances must set the Status to ONGOING in the output if it is called
        during execution of a previous call.<br>
        It shall be stated in the procedure documentation if it supports multiple execution instances.
        If not stated then it does not support multiple execution instances.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="common-procedures">
      <h2>Common Procedures</h2>
      <p>
      The common procedures provide the following services.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Initiating a connection session to a vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
        Terminating the connection session to a vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
        Terminating an ongoing procedure execution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <section id="connect-procedure">
        <h2>Connect</h2>
        <p>Sets up a connectivity session with a vehicle.</p>

        <p>
        This procedure sets up a connection with the vehicle that is associated with the input vehicle globally unique identity.
        This identity may be a pseudo-VIN that has been derived from the vehicle VIN.
        How the client has obtained this identity is out-of-scope for this specification.
        If it succeeds it will return a vehicle Id that shall be used as input in the procedures that require a vehicle Id.
        </p>

        <section id="connect-signature">

              <br>
              Access to the vehicle services or signals might require that a credential is present.
              This parameter should then contain this credential. If it is not required then it shall be set to an empty string.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><code>protocol</code></strong> (<span class="type">string</span>)

              If the connectivity solution that is used by the VAPI implementation supports use of multiple transport
              protocols then this parameter allows the client to select which to use.
              An empty string leaves the selection to the implementation.
              The names representing the supported protocols must align with the names used by the implemented connectivity solution.
